----------
### About
This prototype was created with my co-worker Andy Reitano [@batslyadams](https://twitter.com/batslyadams?lang=en) in 2016 over a couple of days. The goal was to take the video feed from 
User A with the Hololens, feed it to the web browser of User B as an HTML5 canvas, who could then draw on the feed, and return the image to User A.

This was helpful for remote assistance opportunities, where User B needed to view an object, perhaps for repair, and could guide User A running the HoloLens app through voice comunication and 
drawing on the screen.
